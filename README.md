# About the Project👾

The idea of this project is to simulate the sale of tickets for three different movies at a Movie Theater, simulating clients trying to access the system and buy tickets in real-time. You can observe clients entering and leaving the system, as well as the number of available tickets decreasing as they are sold.

## Project Objective 🎯

This project is part of my personal portfolio. Its main purpose is personal learning about thread creation, management, and workflow within a system.

I would greatly appreciate any feedback you can provide regarding the project, code, structure, or anything else that could help me become a better developer!
